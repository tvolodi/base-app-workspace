-- Create test database and user if needed
-- This will be run when the PostgreSQL container starts

-- The database and user are already created via environment variables,
-- but we can add any additional test-specific setup here if needed

-- Create test schema or additional setup can go here
-- For now, the RBAC tables will be created by the test suite itself
